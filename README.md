This repository contains an experiment of Application of Eigenvector Centrality in Ranking Fan-Favorite Characters from Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club written by Muhammad Ghifary Komara Putra (13523066) as an assignment for the IF2123 (Aljabar Linear dan Geometri) course.



Abstractâ€”Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is a Japanese multimedia project centered on a virtual idol group, prominently featured in its television anime adaptation with the same name and the mobile game Love Live! School Idol Festival: ALL STARS. As part of a well-known franchise with an active fanbase, from 2017 to 2019, the project conducted monthly popularity polls for its nine main characters. This paper presents an analysis of the popularity poll results using the eigenvector centrality method. The poll results were transformed into a weighted, directed graph in an adjacency matrix representation of how favorable characters score against one another, presented in two variations for the experiment. Compared to a ranking result from the Borda Count method, one variation showed a balanced score distribution while the other showed a highly skewed score distribution. Through this analysis, it is determined that Setsuna Yuki, Karin Asaka, and Kasumi Nakasu are the top three fan-favorite characters, respectively.
